# Sample Knowledge Base Document

This document is used to test the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
It contains sections, headings, and examples for document parsing and semantic retrieval.

## Section 1: Overview
RAG combines document retrieval with generative AI to provide context-aware answers.
It uses embeddings, vector stores, and LLMs to answer based on uploaded documents.

## Section 2: Example Data
- Author: IOCOD
- Project: RAG Testing
- Date: 2025-10-22

## Section 3: Example Paragraph
Easify is an AI-powered communication and CRM platform that automates business messaging.
By integrating RAG pipelines, Easify can answer customer queries directly from uploaded documents.

## Section 4: Example Table
| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Embeddings | Text converted into vector representation |
| Retrieval | Finds relevant text chunks from the vector database |
| Generation | Uses the LLM to produce answers with context |

## Section 5: Conclusion
This file serves as a benchmark to validate ingestion, chunking, and retrieval accuracy.
